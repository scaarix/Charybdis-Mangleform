# Sourcing the components

## Electronic components

Depending on which version you print, you will need more or less of each component.

The 3d files are designed around a custom sensor PCB:

https://github.com/Bastardkb/charybdis-pmw-sensor

You will need to source all of the components from the sensor PCB's BOM.

Otherwise, you can also use other sensor PCBs, but you will need to modify the 3d adapter files.

Components necessary:
